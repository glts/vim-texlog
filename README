texlog.vim
----------

Syntax highlighting and simple folding for TeX and LaTeX log files.

This Vim syntax plugin introduces the filetype 'texlog'. This filetype is
detected automatically for files with the .log extension and the conventional
magical first line:

    This is .*TeX.*, Version .*

Should filetype detection fail, you can set it yourself with ":setf texlog".

Installation
------------

Move the syntax file into the ~/.vim/syntax directory and the filetype
detection script into ~/.vim/ftdetect (you may have to create that first). On
Windows, replace "~/.vim/" with "~\vimfiles\".

With a plugin manager such as pathogen, the usual procedure applies:

cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone git://github.com/glts/vim-texlog.git texlog
